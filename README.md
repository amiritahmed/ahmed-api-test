Purpose: Enable developers to create integrations, retrieve data, and automate workflows with GitHub

REST API: Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources like repositories, issues, pull requests, and users.

Endpoints: Each API provides endpoints for different GitHub resources (e.g., /repos/{owner}/{repo} for repository actions).

Status and Error Codes: Standard HTTP status codes (200, 201, 401, 404, etc.) are used to indicate success or failure.
